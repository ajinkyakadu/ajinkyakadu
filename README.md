### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational scientist working at EMAT, University of Antwerp. My research focuses on developing variational and deep unsupervised learning approaches for dynamic imaging, high-resolution electron tomography, and spectral imaging.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_dark-field_imaging), [X-ray tomography](https://felixlucka.github.io/assets/talks/XRayTomographyLecture_21_03_2022.pdf), [dynamic imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-cell_imaging), [spectral imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11406.pdf)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [neural volume rendering](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf), [reinforcement learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-e24b50e1d292), [video-editing tools](https://runwayml.com/)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email](ajinkyakadu125@gmail.com), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajinkyakadu/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm excited about startups and bringing new technologies to the market that solves societal problems.

Thanks for stopping by!
