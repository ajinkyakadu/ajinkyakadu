### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational imaging researcher. I hold PhD in Applied Mathematics from Utrecht University in The Netherlands, followed by postdoctoral experiences at Computational Imaging group at CWI Amsterdam and Electron Microscopy lab at University of Antwerp. My research focuses on developing variational and deep unsupervised learning approaches for Dynamic Imaging, high-resolution X-ray and Electron Tomography, and Spectral Imaging.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_dark-field_imaging), [X-ray tomography](https://felixlucka.github.io/assets/talks/XRayTomographyLecture_21_03_2022.pdf), [dynamic imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-cell_imaging), [spectral imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11406.pdf)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [neural volume rendering](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf), [reinforcement learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-e24b50e1d292), [video-editing tools](https://runwayml.com/)
